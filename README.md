# Forensic-Image-Creation
PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for forensic investigation on a Windows PC. Here are some steps you can follow to perform a forensic investigation using PowerShell:

First, identify the purpose of the investigation and gather as much information as possible about the system and the incident. This may include information about the system itself, such as the operating system version, installed software, and hardware components. It may also include information about the incident, such as the time frame in which it occurred, any known indicators of compromise, and any relevant logs or evidence.

Next, create a forensic image of the system. This involves creating a copy of the system's hard drive or other storage media in a forensic-friendly format, such as a .dd file. This will allow you to analyze the system without modifying the original evidence. There are several tools available for creating forensic images, including the built-in Windows tool "dd for Windows" or third-party tools such as FTK Imager.

Once you have a forensic image of the system, you can begin using PowerShell to extract and analyze data. Some useful forensic investigation tasks that can be performed using PowerShell include:

Extracting system information, such as installed software, network configuration, and service configurations.
Examining log files, including the Windows event logs and other application-specific logs.
Analyzing network traffic and extracting data from network captures.
Searching for specific files or patterns of activity on the system.
Analyzing the registry and extracting artifacts from it.
As you perform the investigation, be sure to document your findings and any steps taken. This will help you to recreate your analysis and present your findings in a clear and concise manner.

Finally, once the investigation is complete, ensure that the forensic image and any other evidence is properly secured and stored in a way that preserves its integrity. This will ensure that the evidence is admissible in a court of law, if necessary.

To create a forensic image of the system in a .dd file using PowerShell, you can use the "dd" command-line utility. This utility is included in the Windows operating system and can be used to create a raw copy of a hard drive or other storage media.

Here is an example of how you can use the "dd" utility to create a forensic image of a hard drive in a .dd file:

Open a PowerShell prompt as an administrator.

Identify the drive you want to create an image of. You can do this by using the "Get-Volume" cmdlet to list the available volumes on the system. The drive you want to image will be identified by a drive letter, such as "C:" or "D:".

Create a new .dd file to store the forensic image. You can do this by using the "New-Item" cmdlet, like this:

New-Item -ItemType File -Path "C:\forensic_image.dd"

Use the "dd" utility to create a forensic image of the drive. The syntax for this is:
dd if=<input file> of=<output file> bs=<block size>

For example, to create a forensic image of the "C:" drive and save it to the "C:\forensic_image.dd" file, you would use the following command:

dd if=\.\C: of=C:\forensic_image.dd bs=1024

Note: The "bs" parameter specifies the block size for the image. A larger block size can result in faster imaging, but may also result in a larger file size.

Once the imaging process is complete, you can verify the integrity of the forensic image by comparing it to the original drive. You can do this using a tool such as the "md5sum" utility or by calculating the hash of the image file using PowerShell.
It's important to note that creating a forensic image of a drive can be a time-consuming process, especially for large drives. You should also ensure that you have sufficient disk space to store the image file.

Here is a PowerShell script that you can use to create a forensic image of a Windows 10 PC:


# Set the path to the output file
$outputFile = "C:\forensic_image.dd"

# Set the block size for the image (in bytes)
$blockSize = 1024

# Get the list of available volumes on the system
$volumes = Get-Volume

# Prompt the user to select a volume to image
Write-Host "Select the volume to image:"
$selectedVolume = $volumes | Out-GridView -PassThru

# Confirm the selected volume
$confirm = Read-Host "Create an image of volume $($selectedVolume.Name) (Y/N)?"

# Exit the script if the user did not confirm
if ($confirm -ne "Y") {
  Write-Host "Exiting script."
  return
}

# Create a new file to store the forensic image
New-Item -ItemType File -Path $outputFile -Force | Out-Null

# Use the "dd" utility to create the forensic image
dd if=\\.\$($selectedVolume.Name) of=$outputFile bs=$blockSize

# Display a message indicating that the imaging process is complete
Write-Host "Forensic image of volume $($selectedVolume.Name) has been created at $outputFile"

This script will prompt the user to select a volume from a list of available volumes on the system, and then use the "dd" utility to create a forensic image of the selected volume in a .dd file at the specified output path. The block size for the image can be adjusted by modifying the value of the $blockSize variable.

Note: This script should be run as an administrator in order to have access to the necessary permissions.

Here is a PowerShell script that you can use to extract system information, such as installed software, network configuration, and service configurations:

This script uses the following PowerShell cmdlets to extract the specified information:

Get-WmiObject: This cmdlet is used to query the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) database and retrieve information about the system. In this script, it is used to retrieve information about installed software and network configuration.

Get-Service: This cmdlet is used to retrieve information about the services installed on the system.

Select-Object: This cmdlet is used to select specific properties of the objects returned by the previous cmdlets.

Export-Csv: This cmdlet is used to save the extracted information to a CSV file.

This script will extract the specified system information and save it to CSV files in the root of the C: drive. You can modify the script to save the files to a different location or to extract different types of information.
